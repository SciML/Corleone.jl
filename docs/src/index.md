# Corleone 

## Introduction 

Corleone is a software package aimed at the flexible formulation and fast
solving of optimal control and optimum experimental design problems. 
It uses a first-discretize-then-optimize approach using either 
direct single shooting or direct multiple shooting.

## Features

- Support of ODE and DAE models 
- Single Shooting and Multiple Shooting available
- Flexible initialization of all multiple shooting nodes
- Batch experiments: Experiments can be designed either as single experiments, or optimized simultaneously as batch experiments
- OED: Measurements can be specified either as continuous or discrete

## Installation

To install `Corleone.jl`, run the following 

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Corleone")
