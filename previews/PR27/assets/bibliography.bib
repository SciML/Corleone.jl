  abstract = {Optimum experimental design (OED) problems are typically encountered when unknown or uncertain parameters of mathematical models are to be estimated from an observable, maybe even controllable, process. In this scenario, OED can be used to decide on an experimental setup before collecting the data, i.e., deciding on when to measure and / or how to stimulate a dynamic process in order to maximize the amount of information gathered such that the parameters can be accurately estimated.},

  abstract = {Complex dynamic systems are typically either modeled using expert knowledge in the form of differential equations or via data-driven universal approximation models such as artificial neural networks (ANN). While the first approach has advantages with respect to interpretability, transparency, data-efficiency, and extrapolation, the second approach is able to learn completely unknown functional relations from data and may result in models that can be evaluated more efficiently. To combine the complementary advantages, universal differential equations (UDE) have been suggested. They replace unknown terms in the differential equations with ANN. Such hybrid models allow to both encode prior domain knowledge, such as first principles, and to learn unknown mechanisms from data. Often, data for the training of UDE can only be obtained via costly experiments. We consider optimal experimental design (OED) for planning of experiments and generating data needed to train UDE. The number of weights in the embedded ANN usually leads to an overfitting of the regression problem. To make the OED problem tractable for optimization, we propose and compare dimension reduction methods that are based on lumping of weights and singular value decomposition of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), respectively. They result in lower-dimensional variational differential equations, which are easier to solve and yield regular FIM. Our numerical results showcase the advantages of OED for UDE, such as increased data-efficiency and better extrapolation properties.},

  abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage ``a picture is worth a thousand words'' might well be ``a model is worth a thousand datasets.'' In this manuscript we introduce the SciML software ecosystem as a tool for mixing the information of physical laws and scientific models with data-driven machine learning approaches. We describe a mathematical object, which we denote universal differential equations (UDEs), as the unifying framework connecting the ecosystem. We show how a wide variety of applications, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, can be phrased and efficiently handled through the UDE formalism and its tooling. We demonstrate the generality of the software tooling to handle stochasticity, delays, and implicit constraints. This funnels the wide variety of SciML applications into a core set of training mechanisms which are highly optimized, stabilized for stiff equations, and compatible with distributed parallelism and GPU accelerators.},

  abstract = {Optimum experimental design (OED) problems are optimization problems in which an experimental setting and decisions on when to measure---the so-called sampling design---are to be determined such that a follow-up parameter estimation yields accurate results for model parameters. In this paper we use the interpretation of OED as optimal control problems with a very particular structure for the analysis of optimal sampling decisions. We introduce the information gain function, motivated by an analysis of necessary conditions of optimality. We highlight differences between problem formulations and propose to use a linear penalization of sampling decisions to overcome the intrinsic ill-conditioning of OED. The results of this paper are independent from the actual numerical method to compute the solution to the OED problem and of the question of local and global optima.},
